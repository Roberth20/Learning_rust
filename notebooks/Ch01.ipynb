    "When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an executable in *target/release* instead of *target/debug*. The optimizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one for **development**, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run `cargo build --release` and benchmark with the executable in *target/release.*"
